TODO:
- Run_Left Animation
- Attack left animation
- Attack while running animation
- no swords in falling or jumping animation

Bug:
- Cinemachine confinder snapping when jumping over to the last strech of road in Forest_Tutorial
- Parallax not working when reloading a scene (temp. disabled parallaxing)
- Infinite money bug: Instead of completely hitting the treasure, hit until 1 hit left, then re-enter the area to have all hits again

Performance Issue in Build:
- may have issue with Vsync, build is slower than in Editor (setting vsync to "Don't Count" fix this, but mess up vcam)

Gameplay Improvements needed:
- Camera deadzones tweaks
- Tweak jumping - hovering a bit at peak height
- Sliding when taking damage (cuz using AddForce)

Environment improvements (?):
- use sprite instead of 2D lights for more control?

Programming Improvements needed: (search TODO)
- Save Point Scene Script uses prevScene == "_Preload" instead of "Main_Menu" (_Preload is loaded for a frame for some reason)
- Save Point Scene Script load twice (once in MainMenu, once Save Point Scene Script again)


World:
- Areas should fit a virtue theme (e.g. patience, forgiveness)
